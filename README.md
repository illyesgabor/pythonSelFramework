# pythonSelFramework
 
This project uses: Python, Selenium, PyTest


Testing webpages with Python-Selenium and PyTest using page object model, written in PyCharm IDE.

There are two main tests:
- First: a checkout process of a basic ecommerce webshop (test_e2e.py), with one kind of item and going through a checkout process with explicit wait, assertions and a screenshot at the end. 
- Second: tests the homepage (test_homepage.py) with some forms and chechboxes with two datasets (HomePageData.py). 

This project was used to learn the essentials of Selenium and get an idea of what would a testing framework would look like with basic logging and screenshot functionality with at least two test cases.
